# Fix for Nested _id Fields Causing Duplicate Key Error

## üö® **Problem Identified**
The duplicate key error was caused by `_id` fields in nested objects within your JSON data:

```json
{
  "itinerary": [
    {
      "day": 1,
      "title": "Travel, Raft & Return",
      "description": "...",
      "_id": "68f26fb112206365cef1b01e"  // ‚ùå This causes the error
    }
  ],
  "essentialInfo": [
    {
      "label": "Fitness Level",
      "value": "...",
      "icon": "Award",
      "_id": "68f26fb112206365cef1b01f"  // ‚ùå This causes the error
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-18T05:30:15.120Z",  // ‚ùå This causes the error
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-18T05:30:15.120Z",  // ‚ùå This causes the error
  "__v": 0  // ‚ùå This causes the error
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Created Data Cleaner Utility** (`server/utils/dataCleaner.js`)
- Automatically removes all conflicting fields
- Handles nested objects in arrays
- Deep clones data to avoid mutations

### 2. **Updated Event Controller** (`server/controllers/eventController.js`)
- Uses the data cleaner utility
- Removes `_id`, `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `__v` fields
- Cleans nested objects in `itinerary` and `essentialInfo` arrays

### 3. **Updated Test Script** (`server/scripts/testEventCreation.js`)
- Tests with the exact problematic data you provided
- Demonstrates the fix working

## üõ†Ô∏è **What the Fix Does**

The data cleaner automatically removes these problematic fields:

```javascript
// Before cleaning (your Postman data):
{
  "itinerary": [
    {
      "day": 1,
      "title": "Travel, Raft & Return",
      "_id": "68f26fb112206365cef1b01e"  // ‚ùå Will be removed
    }
  ],
  "essentialInfo": [
    {
      "label": "Fitness Level",
      "_id": "68f26fb112206365cef1b01f"  // ‚ùå Will be removed
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-18T05:30:15.120Z",  // ‚ùå Will be removed
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-18T05:30:15.120Z",  // ‚ùå Will be removed
  "__v": 0  // ‚ùå Will be removed
}

// After cleaning (what gets saved to database):
{
  "itinerary": [
    {
      "day": 1,
      "title": "Travel, Raft & Return"
      // ‚úÖ _id field removed
    }
  ],
  "essentialInfo": [
    {
      "label": "Fitness Level"
      // ‚úÖ _id field removed
    }
  ]
  // ‚úÖ createdAt, updatedAt, __v fields removed
}
```

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Test with Your Exact Data**
You can now use your exact Postman request body - the controller will automatically clean it:
